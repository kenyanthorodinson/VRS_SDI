# VRS_SDI

Vehicle Routing System (VRS) Software Build - Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)
Overview
This repository contains the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) component of the Vehicle Routing System (VRS) software build, designed to optimize urban mobility solutions. The VRS aims to enhance transportation efficiency and sustainability through advanced routing algorithms and geospatial data integration.

Features
Dynamic Routing: Utilizes real-time traffic data to update and optimize routes.
Geospatial Analysis: Integrates various data sources for detailed geographic and environmental insights.
Scalability: Engineered to scale with the growing needs of urban transportation networks.
User-Centric Design: Interfaces designed for ease of use by planners and administrators.
